# Scheduler Bug Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue
No properties were being scraped for the last 2 weeks despite the scheduler appearing to run. There were 4 recurring jobs configured, but they weren't creating job instances.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `should_run_recurring_job()` method in `scheduler.py` had a critical bug:
- It used `job.created_at` as the base time for calculating when jobs should run
- For jobs created weeks/months ago, this produced incorrect next run times
- Example: Job created Sept 12, checked on Oct 14 → calculated next run as Sept 12 1PM
- The time difference (~30 days) never fell within the -60 to 0 second trigger window

## ✅ Solution
Fixed the logic to:
1. Use `last_run` as base time (or `now - 1 day` for new jobs)
2. Check if the next scheduled time has already passed (is overdue)
3. Run jobs that are overdue or within 60 seconds of their scheduled time

## 📊 Test Results
- ✅ Created 9 comprehensive unit tests - **ALL PASSING**
- ✅ Integration tests confirm all 4 recurring jobs now correctly identified
- ✅ Jobs will run immediately when scheduler next checks

## 🎯 Impact
### Before
- ❌ No jobs running for 2+ weeks
- ❌ No new properties scraped
- ❌ Database becoming stale

### After
- ✅ All 4 jobs correctly identified as overdue
- ✅ Will run immediately when scheduler checks
- ✅ Daily scraping will resume according to schedules:
  - FOR_SALE: Daily at 1 PM UTC
  - PENDING: Daily at 2 PM UTC  
  - SOLD: Daily at 3 PM UTC
  - FOR_RENT: Daily at 4 PM UTC

## 📝 Files Modified
1. `scheduler.py` - Fixed the scheduler logic
2. `tests/test_scheduler_unit.py` - New comprehensive unit tests
3. `test_scheduler_fix.py` - Integration test
4. `check_recurring_jobs.py` - Utility to check job status
5. `SCHEDULER_FIX_README.md` - Detailed technical documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. The fix is committed to branch `fix/scheduler-bugs`
2. Test in production by checking if new job instances are created
3. Monitor that properties are being scraped daily
4. Verify database is being updated with fresh property data

## 💡 How to Verify the Fix Works
```bash
# Check recurring jobs status
python check_recurring_jobs.py

# Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests/test_scheduler_unit.py -v

# Run integration test
python test_scheduler_fix.py
```
