# Motivated Seller Scoring Configuration
# Adjust these values to fine-tune the scoring algorithm

# Scoring Configuration Metadata
config_version: "2.0"
# Note: config_hash is auto-generated on load and used to track config changes
# Changing weights only requires score recalculation (no re-detection)
# Changing keywords requires full re-detection + score recalculation

# Signal Weights (total should be ~100)
# How important each signal type is in calculating the overall score
signal_weights:
  explicit_keywords: 50 # Highest priority - explicit "motivated seller" declarations
  price_reductions: 30 # Strong indicator - major price drops
  days_on_market: 15 # Time on market indicator
  distress_keywords: 10 # Keywords like "as-is", "must sell"
  special_sale_type: 5 # Auction, REO, probate, etc.
  recent_activity: 0 # Recent changes/updates - disabled for now

# Price Reduction Scoring
# Points awarded based on price reduction percentage
price_reduction_thresholds:
  major: { percent: 10, score: 30 } # 10%+ reduction = 30 points
  significant: { percent: 5, score: 20 } # 5-10% reduction = 20 points
  moderate: { percent: 2, score: 10 } # 2-5% reduction = 10 points
  minor: { percent: 0, score: 5 } # Any reduction = 5 points

# Days on Market Scoring
# Points awarded based on how long property has been on market
# Updated to award more points earlier, as early DOM signals are strong motivation indicators
days_on_market_thresholds:
  very_long: { days: 180, score: 30 } # 6+ months = 30 points (reduced from 270)
  long: { days: 120, score: 28 } # 4-6 months = 28 points (increased from 25)
  moderate: { days: 90, score: 25 } # 3-4 months = 25 points (increased from 18)
  short: { days: 60, score: 20 } # 2-3 months = 20 points (increased from 12)
  minimal: { days: 30, score: 12 } # 1-2 months = 12 points (new threshold, was 6 at 60 days)
  very_short: { days: 14, score: 6 } # 2 weeks-1 month = 6 points (new threshold)
  immediate: { days: 0, score: 0 } # < 2 weeks = 0 points

# Days Since Last Pending Bonus
# Properties that came back from pending are often more motivated
# This adds a multiplier/bonus based on how recently it returned from pending
days_since_pending_bonus:
  very_recent: { days: 7, score_multiplier: 1.5 } # Within 1 week of pending -> 50% bonus
  recent: { days: 14, score_multiplier: 1.3 } # Within 2 weeks -> 30% bonus
  moderate: { days: 30, score_multiplier: 1.2 } # Within 1 month -> 20% bonus
  none: { days: null, score_multiplier: 1.0 } # Never pending or > 30 days -> no bonus

# Distress Keywords Scoring
# Points awarded for finding these keywords in property description
